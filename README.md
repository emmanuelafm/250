- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by creating user stories out of them, and then organizing those user stories by importance or priority. User stories help the process of interpreting user needs because they provide a standardized way of explaining exactly what is required of the product in order to meet those needs.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by first taking into account the client's outline, then considering user stories, and finally thinking about what I think is best for the product, and whether or not this aligns with the users' and client's requests. An agile process I will consider in the future is the MoSCoW organization method, which sorts user stories by priority level and what needs to be done first. 

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is one who has respect for all other members, stays focused, and holds communication with all necessary parties.
